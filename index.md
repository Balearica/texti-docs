# Overview

Texti is an open source web application for document search and review.  Given a directory containing many types of files (.pdf, .docx, .msg, etc.) Texti extracts text from each file and allows the contents to be searched and reviewed.  When a search result is selected, Texti instantly pulls up the text from the source document in a viewer pane and scrolls to the correct position.  Many document review tasks can be completed faster using Texti compared to searching for files in Windows File Explorer and opening them in Word/Acrobat/etc.
